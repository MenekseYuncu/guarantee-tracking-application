# Installation with Docker
Follow the steps below to run the project using Docker.

- Start PostgreSQL on Docker:
   ```bash
  docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres

  ```

- Run the application inside Docker:

  ```bash
  docker build -t iot-device-management .
  docker run -p 8080:8080 --name iot-device-management --link postgres:postgres -d iot-device-management

  ```



# Database Management
The project uses Flyway for database management. Changes made are automatically applied and can be rolled back. Flyway provides version control of the database schema and keeps the application's database version up to date.

```bash
> mvn flyway:migrate -Dflyway.url=... -Dflyway.user=... -Dflyway.password=...
```

# Test

There are unit tests in the project using JUnit and Mockito. You can use the following command to run the tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```


# Postman API Collection

You can use the Postman API collection to test the project. You can download the Postman collection by following the steps below:
- [Postman API Collection](https://www.postman.com/altimetry-physicist-64740135/workspace/restaurant-management/overview)

- Download the collection file by clicking the link.
- Open the Postman application.
- Click the 'Import' button in the top left corner.
- Select 'Import From Link' option and paste the collection link you downloaded.
- Click the 'Import' button to import the collection.
